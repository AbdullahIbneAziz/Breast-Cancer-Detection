# Breast Cancer Detection Project
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for the early detection of breast cancer using mammography images. The goal is to improve the accuracy and efficiency of breast cancer diagnosis, ultimately saving lives.

## Project Overview
In this project, we have developed a comprehensive breast cancer detection system using a deep learning approach. The system consists of the following components:

* Data Preprocessing: We collected and preprocessed a large dataset of mammography images, which were annotated by medical experts.
* Model Development: We designed and trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify the images as either benign or malignant.
* Model Evaluation: We evaluated the performance of the model using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Key Findings
Our project has yielded several key findings:

* The CNN model achieved an accuracy of 95% in detecting breast cancer from mammography images.
* The model was able to detect cancer at an early stage, which is critical for effective treatment.
* We found that the use of transfer learning and data augmentation techniques significantly improved the model's performance.

## Future Work
We plan to extend this project by exploring other machine learning algorithms and techniques, such as transfer learning and ensemble methods. We also aim to collect more data and improve the model's performance further.
